# Question 1 Describe the role  of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of  how they are used in a program.

# Answer - 1 Predefined keywords in Python Predefined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings
#  and serve specific purposes in the language. They cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names,
#  function names, etc.) because they are fundamental to the syntax and functionality of the language.

# Role of Predefined Keywords:
# 1.	Control Flow: Keywords like if, else, elif, for, while, and break control the flow of execution in a program.
# 2.	Data Types and Structures: Keywords such as class, def, return, and import help define data types, functions, and modules.
# 3.	Exception Handling: Keywords like try, except, finally, and raise manage error handling.
# 4.	Boolean Contexts: Keywords like True, False, and None represent fundamental Boolean values and a null value.

# Examples of Predefined Keywords in a Program:
# Here are some examples that illustrate how these keywords are used in a Python program:


# 1. Control Flow:
# python
# Copy code

age = 18       # here notice that age is a VARIABLE created and defined by user it's not predefined keyword
if age >= 18:  # here, if is a Predefined Keyword
    print("You are an adult.")
else:                              # here else is a Predefined Keyword
    print("You are a minor.")


#2.	Looping:
# python
# Copy code

for i in range(5):       # here, "for" and "in" all are Predefined Keywords
    print(i)


#3. Boolean Values:
# python
# Copy code

is_raining = True        # here, True is a Predefined Keyword
if is_raining:
    print("Take an umbrella.")
